## About

This is a single package Go project where all code lives in `main.go`. This approach is perfect for:

- 🚀 **Quick prototypes** - Get started immediately
- 📚 **Learning Go** - Everything in one place
- 🔧 **Simple tools** - CLI utilities and scripts
- 🌐 **Basic APIs** - Simple web services
- 💡 **Code demos** - Easy to understand and share

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go {{.GoVersion}} or later

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run directly
go run main.go

# Or build and run
go build -o {{.ProjectName}}
./{{.ProjectName}}
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run the application
go run main.go
```

## Next Steps

Add your application logic to `main.go`. Some ideas:

- Add more functions and types
- Read command-line arguments
- Create a simple HTTP server
- Connect to a database
- Read configuration files

## Project Structure

```
{{.ProjectName}}/
├── main.go              # 🎯 All your code goes here
├── go.mod              # 📦 Go module definition
└── README.md           # 📖 This file
```

## Why Single Package?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Simple** - No complex directory structure
- ✅ **Fast** - Quick to set up and understand
- ✅ **Focused** - Everything in one place
- ✅ **Portable** - Easy to share and demo

**When to consider refactoring:**
- 📈 **Growth** - When main.go exceeds ~500 lines
- 👥 **Team** - Multiple developers working on it
- 🔄 **Reuse** - Need to import code from other projects
- 🏗️ **Complexity** - Multiple distinct features

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Build for current platform
go build -o {{.ProjectName}}

# Build for Linux
GOOS=linux go build -o {{.ProjectName}}-linux

# Build for Windows
GOOS=windows go build -o {{.ProjectName}}.exe
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests (add _test.go files as needed)
go test

# Run with coverage
go test -cover
```

### Formatting

```bash
# Format code
go fmt

# Check for issues
go vet
```
