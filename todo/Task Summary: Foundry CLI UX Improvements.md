## ðŸ“‹ **Task Summary: Foundry CLI UX Improvements**

### **Issue Identified:**
The `foundry init` command behavior may be confusing to users - it initializes a project **in the current directory** rather than creating a subdirectory. While this is the **correct behavior** (following Unix conventions like `git init`), the user experience could be clearer.

### **Current Behavior (Correct):**
```bash
foundry init myproject   # Initializes project in current directory
foundry new myproject    # Creates new directory ./myproject/
```

### **User Experience Issues:**
1. **Help text unclear** - Doesn't emphasize the directory behavior difference
2. **No safety warnings** - Could accidentally initialize in wrong directory
3. **Success messages** - Could be more explicit about where project was created
4. **Documentation gap** - Examples don't clearly show the workflow difference

### **Proposed Improvements:**

#### **Priority 1: Improve Help Text**
```bash
foundry init --help
# Should clearly state: "Initialize project IN CURRENT DIRECTORY"

foundry new --help  
# Should clearly state: "Create project IN NEW DIRECTORY"
```

#### **Priority 2: Enhanced Success Messages**
```bash
# Current: "Project 'testproject' initialized successfully!"
# Better: "Project 'testproject' initialized successfully in current directory!"
```

#### **Priority 3: Safety Features**
- Warn if current directory is not empty (unless `--force`)
- Show current path in initialization message
- Optional confirmation prompt for `init` command

#### **Priority 4: Documentation**
- Update examples to show clear workflow differences
- Add section explaining when to use `init` vs `new`

### **Implementation Notes:**
- **No breaking changes** - Behavior is correct as-is
- **Focus on clarity** - Users need to understand the difference
- **Follow conventions** - Similar to `git init` vs `git clone`
- **Quick wins first** - Help text improvements can be done immediately

### **Validation Status:**
âœ… **Functionality works correctly** - Ready for UX improvements
âœ… **CLI architecture solid** - Safe to make message/help improvements
âœ… **No functional changes needed** - Pure UX enhancement task

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours for help text + success message improvements
