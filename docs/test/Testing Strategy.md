## ðŸ“‹ **Recommended Testing Strategy**

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Sweet Spot**

Focus unit testing on the **business logic and transformations** (the pure functions), and use integration tests for the **workflow and external dependencies**. This gives you the best coverage with the least complexity.

The current `add_test.go` tries to unit test everything, including parts that are better suited for integration testing, which is why it ended up with so many mocks and doesn't test the real behavior effectively.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example**

### **Unit Tests For:**
```go
// Test these thoroughly with many edge cases
toSnakeCase(), toLowerRune(), toFileName(), toPackageName()
isValidComponentName(), ValidateComponentName()

// Test with temporary files
detectProjectLayout() // with mock file system setup
```

### **Integration Tests For:**
```go
// Test the full command with real project setup
runAdd() // full end-to-end behavior
```

### **Component Tests For:**
```go
// Test major pieces working together
"validation + file name generation"
"project detection + layout loading"
```
